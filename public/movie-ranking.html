<h1>Marit's favorite movies</h1>
<h2>Top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Mainly because I loved the books as a child, 
    and I have so many good assosiations with them. 
    And of course, I can't remember any other moves at the moment..</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Movies from my childhood. 
    Hated them the first time i saw them since the books are better. 
    Now I've forgotten the books, soo the movies are fun.  
    And off course, I can't remember any other moves at the moment..</p>

<h3>Can't remember</h3>
<p>As I've mentioned twice above, I can't remember a third movie at the moment... 
    There's probably muliple movies I like
    but I seem to have forgotten them.. </p>
