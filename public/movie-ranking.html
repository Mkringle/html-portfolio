<h1>Marit's favorite movies</h1>
<h2>Top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Mainly because the books are so great, 
    and I have so many good assosiations with them. The movies cannot fail.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Movies from my childhood. 
    Hated them the first time i saw them, 
    since the books are so, so much better. 
    However, they've grown to be my favorite movies over the years.</p>

<h3>Can't remember</h3>
<p>I can't to remember a third good movie at the moment... 
    I probably have muliple more movies I love, 
    but I seem to have forgotten them.. </p>
